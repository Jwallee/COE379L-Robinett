Multiple projects for COE 379L: Software Design For Responsible Intelligent Systems
Link: COE379L
Project 1:
Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Processing
Linear Regression on Processed Data
Project 2:
Preprocessing data and more learning techniques
K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression
Project 3: (THIS ONE IS RELEVANT)
Neural Networks for Image Classification
Develop a simple inference server to serve your trained model over HTTP. Hosted in a docker container.
Has 2 Endpoints, one to get info on the server and one to send it binary image information and returns a json classification
Project 4:
Project Proposed to classify AirBnb Image listing to an accurate price, to see how to price your own listings. Can give it images to return an accurate price prediction.
